# FraGoLi v. 1.0.0 \y 2025

The package is mainly designed for the semantics department and focuses on providing a minimal syntax for fast formula derivation. 
Formula-Style is losely based on the accompanying material to an introductory course to linguistic semantics by T. E. Zimmermann.

## Description

The primary goal of this package is to provide a minimal and user-friendly syntax for constructing large and complex semantic derivations, following the specific notational style used at Goethe University Frankfurt. It includes a comprehensive set of commands for text formatting and various types of bracketing, ensuring a consistent styleâ€”particularly when distinguishing between meta-language and object-language within a single derivation or formula.
